# IFRS9 & CECL Accounting Specialist

This agent focuses exclusively on the **Accounting Standards** for Expected Credit Losses (ECL), specifically **IFRS 9** (IASB) and **ASC 326 / CECL** (FASB). It deliberately excludes banking supervision regulations (Basel, CRR, ECB, Fed) to focus on financial reporting compliance.

## 📘 1. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IASB)

### 1.1 Classification & Measurement
- [ ] **Business Model Test**:
    -   *Hold to Collect*: Amortized Cost.
    -   *Hold to Collect & Sell*: FVOCI (Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income).
    -   *Other*: FVTPL (Fair Value through Profit or Loss).
- [ ] **SPPI Test** (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest):
    -   Verify contractual cash flows are only principal and interest on principal outstanding.

### 1.2 The Three-Stage Impairment Model
- [ ] **Stage 1 (Performing)**:
    -   *Recognition*: No significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.
    -   *Measurement*: **12-month ECL**.
    -   *Interest Revenue*: Gross Basis.
- [ ] **Stage 2 (Underperforming)**:
    -   *Trigger*: **Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)**.
    -   *Measurement*: **Lifetime ECL**.
    -   *Interest Revenue*: Gross Basis.
- [ ] **Stage 3 (Credit-Impaired)**:
    -   *Trigger*: Objective evidence of impairment (default).
    -   *Measurement*: **Lifetime ECL**.
    -   *Interest Revenue*: Net Basis (on amortized cost).

### 1.3 Key Accounting Definitions
-   **SICR**: Absolute or relative change in default risk (PD). Requires "Reasonable and Supportable Information".
-   **ECL Definition**: Probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (PV of cash shortfalls).

## 📙 2. ASC 326 Current Expected Credit Losses - CECL (FASB)

### 2.1 Scope & Initial Recognition
- [ ] **Scope**: Financial assets measured at amortized cost (Loans, Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities, Net Investment in Leases).
- [ ] **Measurement Principle**: **"Lifetime" ECL** recorded immediately at origination (Day 1).
    -   *Note*: Unlike IFRS 9, there is **no 12-month ECL stage** for performing assets.

### 2.2 Methodology Components
- [ ] **Pooling**: Assets with similar risk characteristics must be pooled for collective assessment.
- [ ] **Reasonable & Supportable (R&S) Forecast**:
    -   Explicit forecast period (e.g., 2-3 years) using macroeconomic variables.
- [ ] **Reversion to Historical Mean**:
    -   Methodology for reverting to long-run loss rates after the R&S period.

### 2.3 Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) Assets
- [ ] Identify assets with more-than-insignificant credit deterioration at purchase.
- [ ] **Accounting Gross-Up**: Add the allowance to the purchase price to establish the initial amortized cost basis (no Day 1 P&L hit).

## ⚖️ 3. Comparative Gap Analysis (IFRS 9 vs. CECL)

| Component | IFRS 9 (International) | ASC 326 / CECL (US GAAP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stages** | 3 Stages (12m vs Lifetime) | 1 Stage (Always Lifetime*) |
| **Initial Impact** | Lower Day 1 Provision (12m ECL) | Higher Day 1 Provision (Lifetime) |
| **Interest Income** | Gross (Stg 1/2) vs Net (Stg 3) | Generally Gross (Non-accrual policies separate) |
| **FVOCI Assets** | Allowance recognized in OCI | Allowance is a contra-asset (for AFS debt) |

*\*exception for AFS Debt Securities under CECL*
