# IFRS9 and CECL model builder

This project is dedicated to synthesis of the reference IFRS9 and CECL models in python using big LLMs. The idea is to synthesize a python framework from scratch that conforms to the regulation. The resulted codes can be regenerated and updated as the regulation changes.
